h	d20 Amulets
1	Spotted Marble Tablet on simple thread necklace. When the wearer is endangered, a brave dog may arrive to save them. (The player may decide when is appropriate). If the dog dies, the tablet shatters.
2	Quartz crystal. Glows green and gets cold in the presence of those who lack a soul.
3	Caudalion, the tailbone of a snake dipped in wax and wrapped in scented wrappings. Those who bite the wearer save or explode. On a critical hit with a bite or a critical success on the save, the Caudalion explodes instead (1d4 damage).
4	Saint Koran's Box, a fragile thing of gilded ashwood. The wearer gains the memories of anyone whose finger is stored in the box.
5	Brass Fascinus, a miniature phallus with an eremite's enchantment against self-importance. Aids the wearer in playing possum. If someone really especially wants them dead, they won't be able to tell the difference between staying still and being fully expired.
6	Apotropaic Cat's Eye, marinating in a small sack and carried on a catgut necklace. The wearer can see ghosts and spirits even in the deadly dark at a distance of up to 90 feet.
7	"Commandmentine Sigil, a metal amulet in the shape of the old-form ideogram for the word ""eleven"". When held to the wearer's temple, they can scramble any memory they choose to forget, leaving a confused haze of impressions and images. Due to their use as a little-employed but ever-present status symbol among some crime gangs of Tambracola, carrying the sigil is considered a felony all along the Sasuaran Coast."
8	Etched Phulaktarion. Clever ruby lid conceals a small cavity in which a tightly rolled scroll can be stored. Currently holds a religious mantra that serves as a scroll of protection from evil.
9	"Sulfurous Disc. Chunky iron circle on a copper chain. The meaning of the word amulet is ""a piece of jewelry that gets you out of trouble,"" When a screw on top of the disc is twisted, a bullet shoots out, blasting the amulet apart and dealing 1d4 damage, +1d6 if the target was surprised."
10	Seanbane Charm, a crossed-out run cut into polished willow wood. Prevents the thief king Sean from approaching within 15 feet of you, lying to you, or ordering harm done to you. Beware if you walk the roads near Privar, for those who serve him have learned they'll win his gratitude if the slit the throat of anyone wearing such an amulet.
11	Apotropaic Pearl, set in discolored silver. Serves multiple uses. On a critical failure, you may have the pearl shatter to give you a reroll. If set into an eye socket, it sees and can never go blind. If swallowed, it coats the lungs and gives advantage to saves vs inhaled poisons, diseases, and possessions for an hour.
12	Ivory Scarab. Contains 1 MD per day and the spells Book to Beetle and Beetle to Book. (Natural-born beetles tend to turn into devotional poems to nonexistent deities, histories by unlettered laymen, or intricate descriptions of local foliage interspersed with uncompelling romance plots between various beetles.)
13	Rue-Not Vial, a glass vessel full of ground rose petals held on a golden chain. Contains just a little bit of luck, fighting spirit, and grit. When the wearer loses HP, they can spend the luck in the vial to gain 1 HP. It has three charges.
14	Destus Hand, a hinged iron glove fitted on a leather thong. When the wearer saves against a spell, the hand grabs it and throws it back at full strength at a time of the wearer's choosing. Must be worn over the clothes.
15	Staring Bead, a circular piece of painted glass with gold leaf pupil. If the wearer would make a save against a magical effect due to seeing (like a medusa) or being seen (like a cockatrice), instead the bead shatters.
16	Soldier's Charm, a pair of miniature silver bullock horns, sometimes hidden beneath a circular leather flap with a design upon it (so as not to seem untrusting). The horns dig into the wearer and draw blood when the person they're dealing with is betraying a third party, such as their own employer or spouse.
17	Sapphire Medallion, set in a plaster scarab and carried on a golden chain. Blue spells the wearer casts cost 1 MD less to cast.
18	Esher's Needle, a reddened pin stuck in a cork and wrapped in silken thread. When inserted into a body, living or dead, the needle can use them to speak. It contains the person of Esher the Unmatched, a journeyman wizard who lived three centuries ago, lived among the trolls, invented the Rope Trick spell, and advised an unwise king. At ease with his existence as a needle, he is genial and generally helpful.
19	Apotropaic Amber, a disc on waxed-thread cord. When held to the eye, diseases and anything that would cause a save or give you a disease throb redly.
20	Sulcus Badge, a hoofprint symbol stamped in an oak square. Marks the wearer as friend of all centaurs, one of the good ones who won't ask to ride or where your heart is or how you'd wear pants or other annoying shit like that.
